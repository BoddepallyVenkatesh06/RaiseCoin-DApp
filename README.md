## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: We chose Next.js for its robust features, including server-side rendering, static site generation, and a rich ecosystem that enhances the performance and scalability of our application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS allows for highly customizable and responsive designs with utility-first CSS classes. This ensures our UI is both attractive and user-friendly.

### Backend
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. It handles our data storage needs efficiently, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Node.js**: Node.js is used for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it ideal for building scalable and real-time applications. It powers our backend services, providing fast and reliable performance.

### Storage
- **IPFS**: The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file storage protocol that allows for decentralized storage and sharing of files. It ensures data persistence and integrity across the network.
- **Centralized Storage**: We use centralized storage for specific data types that require high-speed access and regular updates. This hybrid approach balances the benefits of decentralization with the practical needs of performance and manageability.

## Project Aim

Our primary focus is to provide a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing UI/UX, addressing a significant gap in the Web3 space. We believe that an intuitive and engaging interface is crucial for the success and adoption of blockchain projects. As we progress, we will continue to enhance and refine the user experience.
